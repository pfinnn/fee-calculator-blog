This AI technology is designed to generate images based on specific inputs, such as keywords, themes, and styles, making it an ideal solution for businesses that need to create eye-catching graphics and images.</span></div><div><p>These are a few examples of artworks that I have created in Midjourney and that are being used by book authors, news papers, musicians and more. The possibilites are endless, although there are limitations.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/fiverr_thumbnail_preview.jpg" alt="midjourney artworks created for buyers on Fiverr" width="3053" height="1767" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-md.jpg 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-lg.jpg 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-xl.jpg 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/6/responsive/fiverr_thumbnail_preview-2xl.jpg 1600w"><figcaption>Midjourney Artworks created for various clients</figcaption></figure><figure class="post__image"></figure></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>On Fiverr, businesses can access a range of AI services, including image generation, that are designed to help them save time and improve their workflows. Whether you need images for your website, social media accounts, or marketing campaigns, Midjourney AI can help you create stunning artworks with ease.</p><p>By using Midjourney AI for your image generation needs, you can save time, resources, and money, while still producing high-quality graphics and images that will engage your audience and help you stand out from the competition. So why not explore the AI services available on Fiverr and see how Midjourney AI can help your business create stunning artworks with ease!</p><p>Check out these community showcases of Midjourney to get an idea of what it is capable to generate. Keep in mind that these images are results of hours of rerolling and prompt-crafting. </p><p><a href="https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/" title="Midjourney Community Showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/</a></p></div></div></div></div><h2>Limitations of Midjourney</h2><p>Midjourney AI is a powerful tool for image generation, but it has some limitations. It may not produce the same level of creativity and artistry as a human artist, and there may be limitations to the complexity and uniqueness of the images generated.</p><p>When you want to use Midjourney, make sure to contact the Fiverr seller first. Let them know the application of the artworks and what exactly you have in mind. Many times, the results will need additional editing and retouching in photoshop. But still, these results are mind-blowing to say the least. </p><p>Limitations are likeliness of real people, because Midjourney will always change something about the face or the appearance. Also hands and general anatomy are difficult to get right with Midjourney. It takes more time or additional editing. </p><h2>AI technology - ChatGPT</h2><p>If you haven't heard of ChatGPT, you must be living under a rock!</p><p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT </a>is a natural language model.
