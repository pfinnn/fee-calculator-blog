<h2><strong>What is Discord?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord is not your typical social media platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord provides users with the ability to host and manage their own community servers . It allows users to stay connected and use text, voice and video chat channels for communication. It has become very popular and continues to grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord also has a lot of automation features with bots, where news are automatically posted, rules of the servers are enforced or even server wide games can be played. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, Discord is not only used by gamers, but popular communities about all sort of topics like game development, freelancing, crypto and day trading, and literally everything people can think of and are interested in.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How can I promote my Fiverr services on Discord effectively?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply posting and spamming your Fiverr gig on every Discord you are in will not get your far. Posting overlong ads wont either. To get you started, follow these three simple steps to promote on Discord:</span></p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your gig impressions, clicks and get more orders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directly promote to your target audience</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn and improve together with other freelancers</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How promotion on Discord can improve your Fiverr gig ranking</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiverr gig ranking is not as simple as it used to be. Fiverr has had a lot of new sellers due to the pandemic and the rise of Freelancing in general. This makes it even more important for new and seasoned sellers to promote their Fiverr gigs on social media. Discord is one way to promote your gigs and it proves to be very effective if done right. Simply posting your gig into the promotion channels is not going to cut it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read this guide to get a better understanding of how you can effectively promote your Fiverr gig on Discord and attract new clients, get clicks and impressions on your gig and improve your gig ranking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, driving organic traffic to your gig through promotion is one way of telling Fiverr that your gig is relevant outside of the enclosed Fiverr platform. Another benefit of promoting on social media, and specifically on Discord, are direct client acquisition. Finally, the gig impressions and clicks of your Fiverr gig are increased through promotion on Discord.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic traffic to your gig can improve your gig ranking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressions and clicks will be higher with promotion on discord</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential clients click onto your gig and may order from you</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can build a network, learn from others and improve</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital advertising in general is growing fast, in the United States alone, the spending on mobile &amp; desktop ads has skyrocketed and surpassed over 100 billion US Dollars per year in 2018. Social media marketing is one important part of digital advertising and can be very effective for Freelancers on Fiverr or any Entrepreneur for that matter. </span></p>

<h2><strong>What are the advantages of Discord promotion compared to other social media platforms?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative social media platform with a lot of active communities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct contact and exposure to potential clients</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive networking opportunities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord as a promotion channel is not very popular with more traditional industries, because the audience tends to be younger than on other social media platforms and there is no general way of buying / displaying Ads. Like on Facebook, Instagram or Google, which use sophisticated algorithms to place advertisements most effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Discord was created for gamers to create communities, naturally the audience of Discord is younger than other social media platforms. This should impact your choice of promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord and will also influence the effectiveness of your promotion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your industry is present in various Discord servers, it can be very beneficial for your business. If your industry is not very popular on this form of social media, you can still create your own community and possibly to attract potential clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, you can use Discord for promoting your Fiverr gigs, build a network and find new clients or boost your gig impressions and clicks. The will vary depending on your industry and other ways of promoting your Fiverr gigs might be more beneficial for your gigs.</span></p>

<h2><strong>These services can be promoted best on Discord</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a freelancer on Fiverr and you have a younger audience, then Discord is the perfect place for you to promote your Fiverr gigs. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up Discord servers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing Discord bots</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering game development service</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube content creation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube thumbnail creation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Editing services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch Streaming Services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media marketing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media profile management</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just examples for Fiverr gigs that can be promoted on Discord most effectively, because the audience on Discord is generally younger and has interest in social media, YouTube and Streaming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does not mean that you cannot promote Fiverr gigs from other industries like programming, SEO, article writing etc. through Discord. You need to follow my advice and be an active part of communities in your niché to do so. It will be a bit more difficult to find the right places, but since Discord is very popular and virtually any topic has its own Discord server, there is a good chance your Fiverr gig category has one as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not, then… You can create your own! </span></p>
<h2><strong>Create your own Discord Community</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Fiverr gig is in a category that is not very popular on Discord, you can start your own Discord server and build a community. It can be a daunting task, but there are many great tutorials out there that should help you get started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have gathered a community of like-minded individuals and people from your industry, you have a great place to advertise and promote your own services there. And even more beneficial, you have become an authority and have a great outreach to potential clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beware though that running and managing a big Discord community is a lot of work and requires more than one moderator, automation through bots, rules enforcing to prevent spamming and much more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in creating your own community for your brand, check out this guide:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/build-a-discord-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://zapier.com/blog/build-a-discord-community/</span></a></p>
<h2><strong>Paid Advertisement on Discord</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask yourself: Can I use paid promotion on Discord for my Fiverr gigs? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes, but it's rather difficult. Some servers offer paid promotion, but it's ineffective compared to advanced advertisement technologies. For example Google Ads will show your Advertisement specifically to potential clients. If you want to use paid promotion on Discord, you should be very specific about your target audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to use paid promotion on Discord, but you have to find the right server with potential clients and most servers do not offer this kind of promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won't recommend using paid ads on Discord, it's very uncommon and unlikely that you find a good server that provides it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do, it's worth a try but make sure it's a server that is in your niché and has enough active members that participate in the server.</span><br><br><br></p>
<h2><strong>Best Discord Servers for Fiverr gig promotion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite discord servers for promoting your Fiverr gigs are listed here. They have a great community with alot of active Sellers and Buyers. Be aware though that Discord has more potential scammers than other social media platforms. These servers, especially the Fiverr insiders server, are safer than others. If in doubt after you've been contacted by an interested client, make sure to contact the server owner or one of the admins.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Fiverr Insiders</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Freelance Nirvana</strong></h3>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image15.webp" alt="" width="500" height="264" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another server I enjoy is “Freelance Nirvana”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana means an ideal or idyllic state or place. This server wants to be a nice place for freelancers to help each other and promote their gigs on Discord. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a big server with over a thousand members with many threads for gig promotion. What I like about this server is that it is not platform specific, but allows for freelancers to find clients independently. It can still be useful for your Fiverr gig promotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I want to recommend you the (unofficial) Fiverr Community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's an unofficial Fiverr server and the biggest discord community for Fiverr sellers and buyers alike. It's moderated through volunteers and rules are enforced strictly, so make sure to read the rules before posting in the gig promotion channels. Since this is a Fiverr promotion server, it's not allowed to post anything unrelated to Fiverr. But, the community is active and people will help you out if you have questions about gig ranking, Fiverr fees, difficult clients and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also host giveaways and have dedicated promotion channels for you to share your Fiverr gigs with others. There are over 5000 members on this Discord server, so the audience is huge. Especially when you share gigs that can be useful to other freelancers, this is a great place to get started promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to join them and be an active and helpful part of the Fiverr community!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this invite link:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Find Niché Discord Servers with potential clients</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rarely find this tip in any of the guides, but it is a crucial tip for promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord effectively!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the discord servers are full of freelancers, but the lack of quality clients. So what's the solution? Find niché discord servers that are evolving around your skills and gig offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be active and helpful on these servers and build a network there. You might be able to get clicks through your gig profile and potential clients can directly find your gigs this way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware though that many servers do not allow advertisement through dm’s (direct messages), so don't start spamming people on these servers, or you will get banned quickly. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Example niché for gig promotion: Game Development</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord servers for game development for example are very popular. If you are a game developer with Fiverr gigs for Unity-Engine or other game engines, you can be an active part of communities like Brackeys. It is full of developers who might need help with their project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can join their Discord server here:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://discord.gg/brackeys"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://discord.gg/brackeys</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brackeys Community has over 17000 members, all are involved with game development, many are still learning. For game developers on Fiverr, this is a great place to promote your gig. Under showcase/advertise, you can post your Fiverr gig promotion in order to attract clients.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image2.webp" alt="" width="256" height="208" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an active and helpful part of the community and have your Fiverr promotion link to your gig in your Discord profile, people you have helped or other people who have noticed you, can find your gig through your activity. </span></p>

<h2><strong>How to find the best niché Discord Servers</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few sites that link and rate Discord servers. You can use these sites to find Discord servers for your own Fiverr promotion. You can directly search for self-promotion channels, or find niché servers that allow you to specifically target your Fiverr promotion towards potential clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a list of popular sites that you can use to find Discord servers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://disboard.org/">Disboard.org</a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://top.gg/">Top.gg</a></span></li>

<h2><strong>Discord Profile tips to get attention from clients</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it simple.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only one sentence / headline + Link to your Fiverr Gig you want to promote</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid spelling mistakes</span></li>
<li aria-level="1">Be active in the communities and get special roles</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of your very limited space on your discord profile is to make people click on your gig. Don't write too much about you, interested clients can read about you and your gig on the actual Fiverr page. No need to clutter your profile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are new to Discord, then you might not know what a Discord profile looks like. It's a bit different or more minimalist than on other social media platforms. It's only shown when clicking on your profile image or name or when hovering over it. It will display a small card that is basically all your profile is. When clicked again, the Discord profile will show mutual servers and the profile description. That's it. No feed. Only a description.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So remember this when creating your discord profile, only u</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">se as much text as neccessary. Use the limited text space wisely to promote your Fiverr gig effectively.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Discord profile example for Fiverr gig promotion</strong></h3>
<p>This is a simple example of the Discord profile text that you could use to get clicks on your Fiverr gig. Dont put too much, don't put anything weird. Just a head line and the link to your gig.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My game development gig:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fiverr link to gig]</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My photoshop editing gig:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fiverr link to gig]</span></i></p>
<p>Here you can see one example for a clean and professional looking discord profile. I asked the NopeFR for permission to use their discord profile as an example.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image9.webp" alt="" width="200" height="169" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image9-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can notice the clean profile logo, the card color matches the profile image and the description is short with a link to his portfolio (alternatively the Fiverr gig)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also improve your credibility on Discord by using a professional looking profile picture and a simplistic name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be personal, since Discord is not a professional social media platform (like Linked.in for example), but it shouldn't be too tacky or weird, because it could have a negative impact on your gig promotion performance in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion for a good profile on Discord:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean and professional logo</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom Banner color</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and concise description</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to your Fiverr gig or portfolio</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to edit your Discord profile?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find the settings under User Settings/Profiles/User Profile</span></p>
<ul>

<li>Edit User Profile or Edit Server Profile (Nitro only)</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can hover over your profile and hit the small edit button in the corner to directly navigate to the edit panel for your Discord profile.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How to add a custom banner color to your Discord profile?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord automatically assigns a banner color to your DIscord profile based on your profile image. If you want to change the automatic banner color to a custom one, you can go into the profile edit settings and add a custom color with the color picker tool.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image5.webp" alt="" width="400" height="475" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image5-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<h2><strong>Being an active and helpful part of the community</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might seem obvious, but I’ve seen many freelancers on Discord that are not active parts of the community. It has a great effect on your reputation, when you help others and share your experiences. On the other hand, asking questions and actively seeking feedback on your work or your gig can be extremely valuable to you and others.</span></p>
<p><strong>Being active and helpful includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback on your work or your gig</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask detailed questions about how Fiverr works</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help others by answering their questions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write detailed answers or  feedback with tips for improvement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help out the moderators by reporting spam</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, this behavior will have a strong impact on your career as a freelancer. It will help </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you make connections to other freelancers and build a network. </span></p>
<h2><br><strong>How to properly ask questions about Fiverr (or anything)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have seen many people asking one liners (sometimes even without question marks …)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad examples for asking feedback:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How to boost Fiverr gig”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How to get order”</span></em></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image13.webp" alt="" width="450" height="360" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image13-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption >Fiverr meme on how to be successful (source own creation)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback like this will never motivate any experienced Freelancer on Fiverr to help you out. People are willing to share their experiences, tips and tricks for your success on Fiverr with you. But not when the questionnaire is not showing any effort. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Discord Promotion: Do’s and Don’ts</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Discord  servers have some kind of promotion or advertisement channels where you can promote your Fiverr gigs and services for free. These channels are dedicated for promotion and can be very active. Some channels also have the Slow Mode activated, which prevents users from posting too often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some tips to follow when promoting your Fiverr gigs in these Discord promotion channels:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Do’s when promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a small and clean advertisement text</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call to action in your promotion text (see the template for discord promotion)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a link embed, or attach a small sample of work if the channel allows it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post a few times a day, but don't spam the channel. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a friendly but professional attitude in your gig promotion. Even though Discord is a casual place, it is always good to have a professional and friendly attitude. Clients appreciate it alot and it will help potential clients to build trust. This already starts with your attitude in your promotion on Discord.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Don’ts when promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not spam your promotion in other channels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use huge promotion texts that fill the whole page, this is considered being a bad sport and puts you in a bad light. Use a reasonable amount of space for your Fiverr promotion.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spelling mistakes. Even the smallest spelling mistake can scare off potential clients. Nobody will ever hire a writer or translator on Fiverr who has spelling mistakes in their description or their gig promotion on Discord.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not overuse smileys/emoticons. It is okay to use a few ones to emphasize certain parts of your promotion (for example the call of action) but do not put checkmarks on all of your Fiverr gig services.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Follow the Discord Server rules: don’t spam &amp; direct messages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tip seems to be obvious, but it happens daily that people do not read the rules and get kicked or banned from Discord servers. This will put you and your promotion in a very bad light or it will completely prevent you from using Discord as a promotion channel for your Fiverr gigs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's why you should always read the rules and have good manners when you are actively promoting your Fiverr gigs  on Discord servers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr gig promotion through direct messages on Discord</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One rule that applies to probably most servers where you would want to promote your Fiverr gigs on is restricted dms for server members. That means that you may not be able to directly message other members of the server). If it is allowed, then you might not be allowed to promote your Fiverr gig or other Discord servers in the dms. This is to prevent spam and scammers from using Discord to their advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to use direct messages for promotion on Discord, make sure you follow the rules of the server to avoid bans or warnings. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr only promotion or any kind of promotion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some servers allow only Fiverr gig promotion, others allow all kinds of promotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules vary from server to server, so you have to make sure to be aware of the specific set of rules that each server has. For example, the Fiverr Community server <strong>ONLY </strong>allows promotion of Fiverr gigs. The promotion needs to include a Fiverr link, otherwise the promoter will be warned and eventually banned from the server. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other servers are less strict. For example the Brackeys Game development community server has dedicated channels where members can promote their freelancing services and show off their gigs. It would be okay to post your Fiverr gig there, but you can also promote your services outside of Fiverr in these channels. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Template for discord promotion Text</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many variations of promotions on Discord, but in my opinion short and concise promotion texts with a call to action are the most effective ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One possible template for your discord promotion follows this simple principle:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotion Title</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-2 Sentences about your gig</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 sentence about your experience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 Call To Action</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to your Fiverr gig that you want to promote</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used this promotion text to for my tool the Fiverr Calculator </span><a href="https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with this Discord Promotion Template:</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image6.webp" alt="" width="500" height="368" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<h3><strong>Examples for a good Discord promotion text for your Fiverr gig</strong></h3>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image8-2.webp" alt="" width="450" height="244" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a clean and structured promotion text with bullet points, a few visual elements for visual appeal and most importantly: A Call to Action to click on the Fiverr gig. This is a great example of a well written promotion text that can help you boost your gigs performance through clicks from Discord.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Example for a short and compact Discord promotion text</strong></h3>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image1.webp" alt="" width="400" height="113" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image1-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a short and compact promotion text. Again, bullet points with the most important features of the Fiverr gig and two visual elements for clarity. It's a compact and short promotion text, but it works. It doesn't take up too much space in the chat and won't seem like spam. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, this example is </span><strong>NOT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perfect and can be improved further.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spelling mistakes in the promotion look unprofessional (“design”, “desing”)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No headline that directly states what this gig is about. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of “here is my Fiverr page”, a call to action would have been better and would turn more impressions into clicks to your Fiverr gig</span></li>

<p><strong>Example for a bad Discord promotion text</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image7.webp" alt="" width="400" height="221" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This example shows how bad a promotion can be. These types of promotions are everywhere on Discord and it's a shame, because these types of promotions will only do you harm instead of boosting your gigs performance. It will make you look unprofessional and have a negative effect on your reputation. </span></p>
<p><strong><em>Why this promotion text sucks:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long list of features in one sentence. Use bullet points to list your gig features!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of white space, that is also irregular. It makes the promotion look visually unappealing, it also seems like spam because it uses so much space in the chat. Some servers, for example Fiverr Insiders (<a href="Fiverr Insiders Discord Invite">https://discord.gg/Cjk97b5cEn</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) , even automute and warn users for using too much white space in their Discord promotions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All CAPS “THANK YOU” is a very bad practice and will make you look unprofessional. Why are you screaming ?!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please dm” is a very needy looking and ineffective call to action. Refer to our “Call to Action Examples for Discord promotions and Fiverr gig Descriptions” (ADD LINK)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why put a TikTok link, when this is supposed to be a Fiverr promotion? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, there are many things wrong with this promotion text and on some Discord servers, these kinds of spammy and unprofessional promotion texts might even get you banned or atleast muted from posting more in the gig promotion channels.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How to get the most out of gig promotion and self promotion channels on Discord</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know how to write great promotion texts and which mistakes to avoid, we can discuss how you can get the most out of these promotion channels. </span></p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 2.28571rem; font-family: var(--font-base); font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); letter-spacing: var(--letter-spacing); font-size: 1.42383em;"><span style="color: var(--headings-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);">Be consistent in promoting your Fiverr gigs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply posting your Fiverr promotion every now and then won't cut it. You need to post it in intervals and make sure you do it at least daily. But, do not spam those promotion channels! Consistency is key, turn promoting your Fiverr gigs into a daily routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, posting your Fiverr gigs or promotions texts in regular intervals  is </span><strong>not enough</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an effective Discord promotion strategy. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Be active and helpful and a build a reputation on the Discord server</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may repeat myself, but this point is important for the effectiveness of your Fiverr promotion on Discord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply post your Fiverr promotion and are not active on the server in any other way, it will look bad and will not help you as much. If you are helping people, share your knowledge (for free) . On the other hand, people will notice you and your promotions will be much more effective.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Posting custom promotions depending on the Discord server</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have found niché servers with potential clients and have established yourself as an active member of the community, you might be able to better understand how these potential clients could be converted into orders on Fiverr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step is not easy to do, it requires time and research of your clients. You need to understand their needs. If you do, you can tailor your Discord promotion for these niché Discord channels specifically to them. Your Fiverr promotion will be a lot more effective this way, because people already trust you and know you are knowledgeable and might be a good candidate for their project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help your Fiverr gig in the long run to get clicks and orders, since people that click on your custom tailored promotions are way more likely to become actual customers and put an order on your Fiverr gig.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Markdown-Example for Fiverr Discord promotion text</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use markdown syntax to have a more sophisticated and professional looking promotion text for your Fiverr gig. It is possible to fatten parts of the text. Do not over do this but use it only for the most important parts of your promotion and only for single words.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Markdown Example</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made this tool for freelancers: Fiverr Calculator</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will help you save money and find the right price for your gigs! :money_with_wings: </span></p>

<h3><strong>Examples for Call To Actions specifically for Fiverr promotions on Discord</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call to actions have proven very effective in motivating the viewer of your Fiverr promotion to click on your gig or order from your services. It is a widely used technique in advertising and digital marketing and you should make use of it! Here are some examples of Call To Actions for your Fiverr promotion on Discord:</span></p>
<ul>

<h2><strong>How to promote your Fiverr gigs in other ways than Discord</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you've read this far, you know how to properly promote your Fiverr gigs through Discord. You are probably looking for ways to promote your Fiverr gig in general, so I wanted to give you a few tips to promote your Fiverr gigs in other ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, there's always room for improvement when it comes to marketing your services. But as you put up your Fiverr gig, you hope to get some attention for it. But how do you go about promoting your gig  and get it in front of potential buyers? By following the tips in this section, you can increase your chances of getting noticed and making a sale through other ways of promotion as well. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Use social media to establish your brand</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Twitter and Facebook are great for getting the word out about your Fiverr gig. Just be sure to use relevant hashtags so that people can easily find your gig. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Place Instagram, Facebook and Google Ads</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not a free way of promoting your Fiverr gigs, but it can be very effective. These ad services are mostly paid only for clicks on your ads and conversion, so the ads are worth it if you set them up right.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tell your friends and family about it</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may not all be potential customers, but they can help spread the word to people who are. It is also valuable to get feedback from your friends and family or even better, industry experts or other freelancers. Don’t be afraid to share your Fiverr gigs with people you know.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Use other online platforms and forums</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of online communities and forums where you can promote your Fiverr gig. Do a little research to find the ones that are most relevant to your gig, and then start sharing! You will be surprised how many forums in your industry are out there. The same rules that I described in this guide for Fiverr Discord promotion apply to promoting your gigs in forums. You need to be an active and helpful part of the community to get the most out of this way of marketing.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Get creative with your marketing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are endless possibilities when it comes to promoting your Fiverr gig. Get creative and think outside the box – the more unique and original your approach, the more likely you are to stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep at it! Promoting your Fiverr gig takes time and effort, but it will all be worth it when you start seeing results. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply the tips and tricks from this ultimate guide to discord promotion for your Fiverr gigs, you might see the results quickly! But remember, you need to be patient, active and consistent. Establish yourself in a world full of other freelancers, who also promote their gigs. It is important that you are yourself and are not afraid to share your knowledge and experience with others. </span></p>

<h2>AI-image generation - Midjourney and Dall-E</h2>

This AI technology is designed to generate images based on specific inputs, such as keywords, themes, and styles, making it an ideal solution for businesses that need to create eye-catching graphics and images.</span></div>
<div>
<p>These are a few examples of artworks that I have created in Midjourney and that are being used by book authors, news papers, musicians and more. The possibilites are endless, although there are limitations.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Midjourney</h2>
<p>Midjourney AI is a powerful tool for image generation, but it has some limitations. It may not produce the same level of creativity and artistry as a human artist, and there may be limitations to the complexity and uniqueness of the images generated.</p>
<p>When you want to use Midjourney, make sure to contact the Fiverr seller first. Let them know the application of the artworks and what exactly you have in mind. Many times, the results will need additional editing and retouching in photoshop. But still, these results are mind-blowing to say the least. </p>
<p>Limitations are likeliness of real people, because Midjourney will always change something about the face or the appearance. Also hands and general anatomy are difficult to get right with Midjourney. It takes more time or additional editing. </p>
<h2>AI technology - ChatGPT</h2>
<p>If you haven't heard of ChatGPT, you must be living under a rock!</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT </a>is a natural language model. AI that you can ask anything and that will return cohesive sentences about any topic. You can write whole articles with it (this one is human written though, it cannot fully replace human writing. 🤓 )</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading my guide to the new AI services on Fiverr. They are blowing up right now, so make sure to stay on top of the changes in the business world! Never be afraid to try out new things, but also make sure to know how much a great (human) writer or artist is worth! AI may have incredible results, but the work of some talents is still unreachable for AI. And without their talent, it would not be possible for the AI to be trained in such a way.</p>

<h2><strong>Gigs related to YouTube</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is one of the biggest platforms creating content. It is run by Google and has billions of dollars in Ad revenue every year. That is a lot of money! And you can benefit from this massive economy by offering related services on Fiverr. It is a future proof way of making money, since YouTube is an ever growing giant platform with many different forms of content. This will allow you to find a niché category within YouTube content creators that you can specifically target for your Fiverr gigs. This way you may be able to find some new gig ideas to make money on Fiverr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are various gig ideas you can offer related to YouTube:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thumbnail Design</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Editing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topic / Keyword Research</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitor Analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO for description and video titles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Scripting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Translation / Transcribing</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that you try to be specific and target down a specific set of content creators who might need your help. The more specialized you are, the better. But don't niché down too deep, since it might also limit you in your capabilities of receiving new orders. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Current revenues of Youtube and expected growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at this statistic that will show you how much money is made on YouTube every year and how the expected growth is providing you a good future proof opportunity to earn money on Fiverr. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022.png" alt="" width="1000" height="743" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>

<h2><strong>Translation gigs</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the best ways to get started on Fiverr. You can translate english into your native language and when you speak a language that not many people offer, you can still </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a good chance of making some quick sales on Fiverr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, you can try to find an unsaturated niché and offer specialized translations. Translating from Technical English to Technical Spanish and vice versa for example.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Game development in Unity or Godot</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game development is very popular and it is easy to teach yourself through YouTube channels like brackeys. If you are capable of creating your own small projects, you will be able to provide these services on Fiverr and make money quickly. Beware that you need some kind of proof of work and work samples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started, Godot is much easier and it's also faster in developing simple games. So if you plan to make quick money, you might want to check out this game engine as well.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Creating Advertisements and Marketing strategies</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spending on mobile and desktop Advertisement is a growing market. Especially the mobile advertisement sector is expecting strong growth in the next few years according to statista.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022.webp" alt="" width="1000" height="743" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-xs.webp 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-sm.webp 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-md.webp 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-lg.webp 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-xl.webp 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/statistic_id289657_youtube_-global-advertising-revenues-as-of-q2-2022-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To benefit from this strong market sector, you can offer related services on Fiverr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These gig ideas can help you make money on Fiverr in this sector. They have a strong potential even in the years to come:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Marketing strategy for every platform</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a YouTube marketing strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a TikTok marketing strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating Video advertisement optimized for mobile ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up an advertising campaign on Google Ads</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: You need a certain set of skills to offer gigs on Fiverr in this category. Not everyone is familiar with effective marketing strategies and if you want to be successful on Fiverr and actually make money off your gigs, you need to offer valuable skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get started and learn how to create effective marketing plans to offer as a Fiverr gig, you can start by checking out this TED Talk:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoD8RMq2OkU</span></a></p>
<h2><strong>Research Services</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offer doing research for others. If you are familiar with a field and have experience in this, you can offer research for nichés. For example medical research, travel research or freelancing. It can be research about anything and if you choose the right category, you can secure a few quick sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to make quick money in this category, try to be as specific as possible and find a small area that you can cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas for more specific research categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical information</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel destinations and guides</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">News trends and public figures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">History (Medieval, Ancient, Roman Empire, Cold War, World Wars etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelancing and Business Trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books and Literature</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Discord Server setups</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a quickly growing category, because Discord becomes more and more popular outside of the gaming community where it originated. You can offer Discord server setups, bot automation and more. These types of orders are not too difficult to finish and can help you make fast money on Fiverr. It is however going to be highly saturated soon, so make sure to get in there quickly and establish yourself as a trusted Seller on Fiverr.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Discord Bot Programming</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Discord Server setup, you can offer to program and create Discord bots for server automation. These bots can do all kinds of tasks and can be very complex or rather simple. If you have basic programming skills in Python, you can easily get started and jump on the train of this quickly growing Fiverr category.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Business Names and Slogans</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This category is well established, but everyone with a creative and business mind can offer these services and think of great names and slogans for companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But be aware, this is again, not an easy way to make money. (There is no easy way to make money on Fiverr), because coming up with business ideas and slogans sounds easier than it is. Good business names convey various images of a business and can also have a subconscious layer. So don't jump right into this gig idea, but make sure you are capable of delivering amazing results, otherwise the start as a new seller on Fiverr will be way more difficult. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Greeting Videos</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first categories of Fiverr gigs that went viral! Think of Fiverr Jesus, or other unique ways of creating greeting videos that went viral on YouTube and social media. Funny and creative greetings videos are still a thing and if you come up with crazy and funny ideas, you can still make a quick sale here as well. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Writing Gigs</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another gig category that you can get into is Article &amp; Blog Writing. Don't get me wrong, writing requires a variety of skills. Creative thinking, understanding of flow of writing and grammar. But, when you are capable of writing fluently in your language, you will be able to offer these services on Fiverr and make some quick money as well. These Fiverr gigs are very popular and it will not be the easiest start, but if you pick one of the examples here you might get a headstart in an unsaturated niché.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article writing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blog Posts Writing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Emails</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging Social Media posts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media captions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tweets about NFTs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products Description</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business names and slogans</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Articles about comedy, freelancing, travel guides, diet plans, business ideas</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Image Editing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another common gig idea for beginner sellers on Fiverr is image editing. If you know your way around photoshop editing, you can use this tool in many ways to make money on Fiverr. Again, you can be very specific to establish yourself in an unsaturated category. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beautify your portraits in photoshop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove your background (note: this is very saturated, MANY sellers offer this.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convert images and logos to vector graphics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coloring of old photos</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have a Photoshop license (which is required to sell your work!) You can look at free alternatives like </span><a href="https://www.gimp.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.gimp.org/</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can do most of the things photoshop can do and it's completely free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background Removal is one of the easiest ways to make money on Fiverr, but it was advised so many times and everybody can do it, so you will have a hard time to find customers as a new seller. Still, I will leave this free tool here to remove backgrounds from images that you can use in your Fiverr gig.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Free tool for Background Removal</strong></h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/background-removal.jpg" alt="" width="2504" height="673" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-xs.jpg 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-sm.jpg 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-md.jpg 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/5/responsive/background-removal-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, I offer you some starting points as a new seller on Fiverr. These gig ideas are not a 100% guarantee that you will make money on Fiverr or even receive an order! But, when you offer a valuable skill that you are able to show examples of, the possibility is good that you will land your first order with these gig ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have learned about these possible ways to make money on Fiverr:</span></p>

<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #1 - Stay Online 24/7</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying online 24/7 to boost your gig ranking performance is a myth and does not help at all. No single human can be online all the time, only bots and auto refreshers can. Fiverr might consider your account suspicious when it is online 24/7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if you are online, get a message but are not able to properly answer your client (because you actually sleep) it will make a much worse impression than answering when you are back online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a client sees your gig and the gig is well made, with promising work samples and a well made and concise gig description, the client will be compelled to message you. Not because you are online, but because your work looks promising! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What's more important than your online time is your answer rate and your average response time.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #2 - Instant responses and 100% response rate</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instant responses with a very low response rate increase gig traffic and ranking.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that the response time matters. Remember you have 24 Hours to respond! After that it will negatively affect your response rate and this will in turn have a negative effect on your gig ranking &amp; impressions. So keeping a 100% is possible and important for your gig ranking. But it is easy to do it yourself. There is no need for automatic responses that will automatically keep your response rate at 100%. Be careful about that response rate, because it can derank you if you already have a Fiverr Seller Level.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being responsive and active is important to be successful on Fiverr. Even more important is how you respond. But what is key when getting a message in from someone in your Fiverr inbox that seems interested in your services? <span style="font-weight: 400;">What clients actually want is an honest, concise answer of you will be the right choice. Show your client a solution strategy  and how you would tackle their problem. This will increase their confidence to make the right decision when hiring you. </span></p>

<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #3 - Gig rotation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gig rotation was a thing on early Fiverr, but since the freelancing platform has seen a massive growth in new sellers and buyers, the simple rotation of gigs to the first places in search results is over. New sellers need to be way more thoughtful about their gig category and service niché when creating a new gig. Some categories are so overwhelmed with offers and are so competitive, that you will have a hard time starting out. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if you use correct keywords, preferably keywords that are not overused by other sellers, you have a good chance of landing your first orders and gaining a reputation as a good seller. Getting 5-star reviews will help boost your gig ranking and performance and increase your impression and click rate a lot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiverr gig rotation is a myth, but it's not 100% untrue. The search results have improved a lot since the early days of Fiverr and now they are tightly based on the buyers portfolio as well as the sellers skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rotation is there, but it's minimal. There is randomness involved. It only switches around the gigs when the results show, but Fiverr will not randomly rotate gigs down and up the search results. The algorithm is much more advanced than that. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #4 - Review exchange can boost your Fiverr gig performance</strong></h2>
<div>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/4/no_1.gif" alt="" width="211" height="264"></figure>
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no…</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Review exchange is against Fiverr’s terms of service and will get you banned quickly. It is also very obvious. Fake reviews are also not worth it.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviews do not have the weight as they used to be, but reviews from Fiverr Select buyers, or repeating buyer reviews are something that can really boost your gigs ranking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviews that did not come from your amazing work and professional attitude will just result in your gig or account being banned. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anybody offers you a review exchange or suggests it to you, block them and move on. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #5 - Offering free work can help you get started</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big no from me. This is very bad advice in my opinion! Offering free work will put you in a bad light. There is no reason that you should ever offer your work for free. People will reach out to you and you might get some exposure by offering free work, but in the end these people are only going to use you and won’t ever see you as a freelancer who they need to pay.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Stick to your prices, know your worth and the worth of your work. </strong></em></p>
<p>There is an exception to this rule. If you don't have the proper skills to offer services, then you should not trick any buyer into spending money on  you. Its okay to build your portfolio with projects from others. I still recommend you to find your own ideas for projects, these will help you learn much more than doing work for free. </p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth # 6 - Send as many buyers requests as possible</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending all possible buyers requests is not worth your time and will not help you get sales and orders quicker. Only send buyers requests that you think you can actually provide a valuable offer for. Take the time and write a detailed solution strategy and why the client should hire you. Don't go overboard and write too much. Be concise and try to make a sale! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spamming those buyer requests won't help your gig performance or conversion<strong> at all</strong>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #7 - Promote your Fiverr gigs on Social Media</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been said before, but posting your gigs on your personal social media account wont help you at all. These people that you will reach through your promotion are not potential clients. Find out better ways to promote your Fiverr gigs and try to reach out directly to potential buyers. Read more about “How to promote your Fiverr gigs on Discord” in our upcoming guide. There you will learn how you can use Discord for promoting directly to your target audience and build a network of potential clients.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #8 - Fiverr is easy and fast money</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not at all. Fiverr is a highly competitive marketplace with low prices and very skilled freelancers offering their work. If you do not put in the time to create a gig that sticks out and follows all the rules of SEO, with good work samples, then you will have a very hard time on Fiverr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need a skillset that people are willing to pay money for, otherwise it is unlikely that you will get easy and fast money, if any. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #9 - Fiverr and Paypal have no fees</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiverr does have a <strong>20% fee for sellers</strong>. The fiverr fees are what they are and it's not a small amount of money. Additionally, the withdrawal on Fiverr can also include fees from Payoneer, the Fiverr Revenue Card or through PayPals currency conversion fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you can keep track of your fiverr fees using the<a href="https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator" title="Fiverr Fees Calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Fiverr Fees Calculator</a>. </span>Use it to determine your hourly rate after all the fees were calculated. 👍</p>

<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #10 - Making money on Fiverr is passive income</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people that post and comment about their Fiverr experience label their income as passive income. That is NOT the case! Fiverr orders have to be actively worked on, sometimes with unexpected challenges and more effort than you anticipated. Having a successful Fiverr profile, even for some easy side money / beermoney, Fiverr requires sellers to be active alot. You need to answer messages, respond properly to get orders, and update your gigs. Only the process of researching a category that you can create your gig in, writing optimized descriptions and titles can take a lot of work if done right.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling making money on Fiverr passive income is just plain wrong. But, it can be less stressful than a side job (as a student for example) because you can always decide yourself how much work you take on. So as a side hustle for easy money it can be a great opportunity, but it's never passive. Your Fiverr Seller profile always needs your attention, otherwise it will go downhill quickly.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fiverr Myth #11 - Anybody can be successful on Fiverr</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way that is true. It is true, because anybody can learn valuable skills these days. YouTube is full of free tutorials, you can find virtually any question answered through Google or DuckDuckGo. There are huge amounts of resources on any skill you like to learn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, without a valuable skill that people are willing to pay real money for, you are never going to be successful on Fiverr. It's the hard truth, but if you are here to look for fast and easy money on Fiverr, I can tell you with certainty that you are on a path that is never gonna lead to success.</span></p>
<h2>Fiverr Myth #12 - Success is based on luck</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot make it on Fiverr or as a Freelancer. Only lucky people or very smart people can be successful. You should just give up. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But thats not the case. You can. Everyone can. If you want it hard enough. 😎</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick a skill that you want to provide and <strong>LEARN AND MASTER IT</strong>. Put in the time and effort, ask other people who have those skills for feedback. </span></p>
<p><strong>Improve, fail, improve, and repeat. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until you finally have the skills that you need to be successful on Fiverr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These skills can include programming, search engine optimization skills, advanced photo editing and many many more. The more difficult the skill is to learn, the better people will pay you for your work. That's the way it works in the business world and Fiverr is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So get started today. Stop wasting time. Learn the skills you need and improve them until you have the tools to be successful. </span></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for reading and good luck!</strong></p>

<p>But first, let me show you the results of using a video thumbnail for your Fiverr gig. It has a visible impact and it will improve your chances of success on Fiverr.</p>
<h2>Higher impressions on Fiverr gig after uploading a video thumbnail</h2>

<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/fiverr_gig_performance_1.png" alt="fiverr gig boost after uploading video thumbnail" width="346" height="268" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/fiverr_gig_performance_1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>

</figure>
<p>But, how do you create a video that will help your Fiverr gig performance?</p>
<p>If you are not a professional with video editing software like Adobe Premiere and After Effects, you can use a free video editor that I found and used for my own Fiverr gig video. It is easy to use and gives you the option to choose different animation / transitions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 1 – Collect your best work samples</h2>
<p>This is a crucial step! You want amazing work samples to showcase in the video, this is more important than anything else. If you don’t have a lot of work samples, my advice is that you create more personal projects so you have enough work samples for your Fiverr gig video.</p>
<p>Great work samples need to fulfill these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>showing the best of your abilities</li>
<li>be proof of the quality that you promise to provide</li>
<li>have a realistic purpose, but do not have to be real client work</li>
<li>do not have any errors or mistakes in them</li>
<li>easy to understand</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2 – Create animated images inforgraphics with Pixlr</h2>
<p>This free image editor allows you to create images and edit your work samples. You could add arrows for example. Then, you can use their animaton tool for images. It will create a cool animation of your image elements which you can use in your Fiverr video thumbnail.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/animate-image-pixlr.gif" alt="Use animated images for your Fiverr video thumbnail" width="348" height="220"></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_page_animation.png" alt="animations for image transitions" width="191" height="230" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>You can simply select one of the animation styles (some are free, some are only for premium) but the freebies are very good and sufficient for creating an enganging Fiverr video thumbnail.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 3 – Use flexclip for easily creating free video thumbnails for Fiverr</h2>
<p>Now when you have work samples and animated images ready, you can start creating and editing your video thumbnail for Fiverr in this free video editor. <a href="https://www.flexclip.com/editor/app?ratio=landscape">https://www.flexclip.com/editor/app?ratio=landscape</a></p>
<p>It is a free tool and super easy to use. They also have a lot of templates to use as starting point, but I suggest you start with an empty project and create everything yourself. It is not as difficult as it seems if you follow this guide on how to create a video for Fiverr thumbnail step by step!</p>
<h2>Step 4 – Import Media to Flexclip</h2>
<p>Create a new video project on flexflip and import your media. Images, videos, anything you created in the first steps and that you want to show in the video thumbnail when someone sees your Fiverr gig in the search results.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_import.png" alt="import your own media" width="532" height="411" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 5 – Drag and drop all your samples and animated images into the timeline</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_animated_images.png" alt="video thumbnail creation step 5" width="504" height="477" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>After you imported your media files to the video editor, you can start drag and dropping the images and animated images onto the timeline (in the bottom)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 6 – Arrange your media on the timeline of your video thumbnail</h2>
<p>After you have arranged everything in the order you want the video to showcase your work, you can start to add transitions and animations. Click on each image in the timeline and then select the animation menu from the top bar.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_video_timeline.png" alt="video thumbnail creation step 6" width="588" height="449" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 7 – Animate your images</h2>
<p>The animation menu will show and allow you to pick an animation for the image. I like the zoom in and out options. But be careful not to overuse the animations. It’s a good idea to only use it on the most special images.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_animate.png" alt="animate images for your video thumbnail" width="588" height="438" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-xs.png 300w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-sm.png 480w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-md.png 768w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-lg.png 1024w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-xl.png 1360w ,https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 8 – Find a free soundtrack</h2>
<p>There are tons of musicians that offer their music and sounds for free on the internet!</p>
<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/music/">https://pixabay.com/music/</a></p>
<p>Pixabay for example is a great resource for music and soundtracks. If you like, you can credit the musician for their free work. But it is not a neccesity.</p>
<p>Always make sure you use music and images that are royalty free, meaning you can freely use them, otherwise Fiverr will delete your video thumbnail and might even deactivate your gig or ban your account. So make sure to use soundtracks from Pixabay in your Fiverr video thumbnail.</p>
