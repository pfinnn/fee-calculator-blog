It is easy to use and gives you the option to choose different animation / transitions.</p><p> </p><h2>Step 1 – Collect your best work samples</h2><p>This is a crucial step! You want amazing work samples to showcase in the video, this is more important than anything else. If you don’t have a lot of work samples, my advice is that you create more personal projects so you have enough work samples for your Fiverr gig video.</p><p>Great work samples need to fulfill these requirements:</p><ul><li>showing the best of your abilities</li><li>be proof of the quality that you promise to provide</li><li>have a realistic purpose, but do not have to be real client work</li><li>do not have any errors or mistakes in them</li><li>easy to understand</li></ul><h2>Step 2 – Create animated images inforgraphics with Pixlr</h2><p>This free image editor allows you to create images and edit your work samples. You could add arrows for example. Then, you can use their animaton tool for images. It will create a cool animation of your image elements which you can use in your Fiverr video thumbnail.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/animate-image-pixlr.gif" alt="Use animated images for your Fiverr video thumbnail" width="348" height="220"></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_page_animation.png" alt="animations for image transitions" width="191" height="230" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_page_animation-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>You can simply select one of the animation styles (some are free, some are only for premium) but the freebies are very good and sufficient for creating an enganging Fiverr video thumbnail.</p><p> </p><h2>Step 3 – Use flexclip for easily creating free video thumbnails for Fiverr</h2><p>Now when you have work samples and animated images ready, you can start creating and editing your video thumbnail for Fiverr in this free video editor. <a href="https://www.flexclip.com/editor/app?ratio=landscape">https://www.flexclip.com/editor/app?ratio=landscape</a></p><p>It is a free tool and super easy to use. They also have a lot of templates to use as starting point, but I suggest you start with an empty project and create everything yourself. It is not as difficult as it seems if you follow this guide on how to create a video for Fiverr thumbnail step by step!</p><h2>Step 4 – Import Media to Flexclip</h2><p>Create a new video project on flexflip and import your media. Images, videos, anything you created in the first steps and that you want to show in the video thumbnail when someone sees your Fiverr gig in the search results.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_import.png" alt="import your own media" width="532" height="411" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_import-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p> </p><h2>Step 5 – Drag and drop all your samples and animated images into the timeline</h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_animated_images.png" alt="video thumbnail creation step 5" width="504" height="477" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animated_images-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>After you imported your media files to the video editor, you can start drag and dropping the images and animated images onto the timeline (in the bottom)</p><p> </p><h2>Step 6 – Arrange your media on the timeline of your video thumbnail</h2><p>After you have arranged everything in the order you want the video to showcase your work, you can start to add transitions and animations. Click on each image in the timeline and then select the animation menu from the top bar.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_video_timeline.png" alt="video thumbnail creation step 6" width="588" height="449" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_video_timeline-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p> </p><h2>Step 7 – Animate your images</h2><p>The animation menu will show and allow you to pick an animation for the image. I like the zoom in and out options. But be careful not to overuse the animations. It’s a good idea to only use it on the most special images.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/flexclip_animate.png" alt="animate images for your video thumbnail" width="588" height="438" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/flexclip_animate-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p> </p><h2>Step 8 – Find a free soundtrack</h2><p>There are tons of musicians that offer their music and sounds for free on the internet!</p><p><a href="https://pixabay.com/music/">https://pixabay.com/music/</a></p><p>Pixabay for example is a great resource for music and soundtracks. If you like, you can credit the musician for their free work. But it is not a neccesity.</p><p>Always make sure you use music and images that are royalty free, meaning you can freely use them, otherwise Fiverr will delete your video thumbnail and might even deactivate your gig or ban your account. So make sure to use soundtracks from Pixabay in your Fiverr video thumbnail.</p><p>You can use the keyword “cinematic” for example to find epic soundtracks. Depending on your Fiverr gig, you want to search for different soundtracks that fit your video thumbnail best.</p><h4><strong>Example cinematic soundtracks</strong></h4><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/free_soundtrack.png" alt="example cinematic soundtracks" width="732" height="230" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/free_soundtrack-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Source: <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/search/cinematic/">https://pixabay.com/music/search/cinematic/</a></p><p> </p><h2>Step 9 - Add the Audio to your video thumbnail</h2><p>Now  that you have selected a soundtrack / music for your Fiverr gig, you can add it the video in the video editor by clicking on the Add Audio button in the bottom left.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/add_audio_fiverr_video.png" alt="add audio to your video" width="502" height="220" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-xs.png 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-sm.png 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-md.png 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-lg.png 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-xl.png 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/3/responsive/add_audio_fiverr_video-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p> </p><h2>Step 6 – Upload your new video thumbnail to your Fiverr gig page</h2><p>On your Fiverr dashboard, open your gigs table.
