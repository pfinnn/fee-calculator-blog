Fiverr has had a lot of new sellers due to the pandemic and the rise of Freelancing in general. This makes it even more important for new and seasoned sellers to promote their Fiverr gigs on social media. Discord is one way to promote your gigs and it proves to be very effective if done right. Simply posting your gig into the promotion channels is not going to cut it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read this guide to get a better understanding of how you can effectively promote your Fiverr gig on Discord and attract new clients, get clicks and impressions on your gig and improve your gig ranking. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, driving organic traffic to your gig through promotion is one way of telling Fiverr that your gig is relevant outside of the enclosed Fiverr platform. Another benefit of promoting on social media, and specifically on Discord, are direct client acquisition. Finally, the gig impressions and clicks of your Fiverr gig are increased through promotion on Discord.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic traffic to your gig can improve your gig ranking</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressions and clicks will be higher with promotion on discord</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential clients click onto your gig and may order from you</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can build a network, learn from others and improve</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital advertising in general is growing fast, in the United States alone, the spending on mobile &amp; desktop ads has skyrocketed and surpassed over 100 billion US Dollars per year in 2018.

Like on Facebook, Instagram or Google, which use sophisticated algorithms to place advertisements most effectively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Discord was created for gamers to create communities, naturally the audience of Discord is younger than other social media platforms. This should impact your choice of promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord and will also influence the effectiveness of your promotion. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your industry is present in various Discord servers, it can be very beneficial for your business. If your industry is not very popular on this form of social media, you can still create your own community and possibly to attract potential clients.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, you can use Discord for promoting your Fiverr gigs, build a network and find new clients or boost your gig impressions and clicks. The will vary depending on your industry and other ways of promoting your Fiverr gigs might be more beneficial for your gigs.</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image10.webp" alt="" width="550" height="550" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image10-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27749/discord-popularity-by-country-gcs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.statista.com/chart/27749/discord-popularity-by-country-gcs/</span></a></p><h2><strong>These services can be promoted best on Discord</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a freelancer on Fiverr and you have a younger audience, then Discord is the perfect place for you to promote your Fiverr gigs. </span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up Discord servers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing Discord bots</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering game development service</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube content creation</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube thumbnail creation</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Editing services</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch Streaming Services</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media marketing</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media profile management</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just examples for Fiverr gigs that can be promoted on Discord most effectively, because the audience on Discord is generally younger and has interest in social media, YouTube and Streaming. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That does not mean that you cannot promote Fiverr gigs from other industries like programming, SEO, article writing etc. through Discord. You need to follow my advice and be an active part of communities in your niché to do so. It will be a bit more difficult to find the right places, but since Discord is very popular and virtually any topic has its own Discord server, there is a good chance your Fiverr gig category has one as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not, then… You can create your own! </span></p><h2><strong>Create your own Discord Community</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Fiverr gig is in a category that is not very popular on Discord, you can start your own Discord server and build a community. It can be a daunting task, but there are many great tutorials out there that should help you get started. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have gathered a community of like-minded individuals and people from your industry, you have a great place to advertise and promote your own services there. And even more beneficial, you have become an authority and have a great outreach to potential clients. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beware though that running and managing a big Discord community is a lot of work and requires more than one moderator, automation through bots, rules enforcing to prevent spamming and much more. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in creating your own community for your brand, check out this guide:</span></p><p><a href="https://zapier.com/blog/build-a-discord-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://zapier.com/blog/build-a-discord-community/</span></a></p><h2><strong>Paid Advertisement on Discord</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might ask yourself: Can I use paid promotion on Discord for my Fiverr gigs? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes, but it's rather difficult. Some servers offer paid promotion, but it's ineffective compared to advanced advertisement technologies. For example Google Ads will show your Advertisement specifically to potential clients. If you want to use paid promotion on Discord, you should be very specific about your target audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to use paid promotion on Discord, but you have to find the right server with potential clients and most servers do not offer this kind of promotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won't recommend using paid ads on Discord, it's very uncommon and unlikely that you find a good server that provides it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do, it's worth a try but make sure it's a server that is in your niché and has enough active members that participate in the server.</span><br><br><br></p><h2><strong>Best Discord Servers for Fiverr gig promotion</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My favorite discord servers for promoting your Fiverr gigs are listed here. They have a great community with alot of active Sellers and Buyers. Be aware though that Discord has more potential scammers than other social media platforms. These servers, especially the Fiverr insiders server, are safer than others. If in doubt after you've been contacted by an interested client, make sure to contact the server owner or one of the admins.</span></p><h3><strong>Fiverr Insiders</strong></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image12.webp" alt="" width="500" height="283" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image12-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This server is small, but it’s full of active and helpful people. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you join, share your gig in the gig promotion channel. The server owner will remove inactive members, to keep it small and active. It’s a very helpful community, if you ask the right questions. </span><a href="https://fee-calculator.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fee-calculator.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a sponsor of this server.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join right now through this invite link: </span><a href="https://discord.gg/Cjk97b5cEn"></a><a href="Fiverr Insiders Invite Link">https://discord.gg/Cjk97b5cEn</a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also join the Quora Space of Fiverr Insiders where useful info about Fiverr fees, Fiverr gig ranking and more is shared.  </span></p><p><a href="https://fiverrinsiders.quora.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fiverrinsiders.quora.com/</span></a></p><h3><strong>Freelance Nirvana</strong></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image15.webp" alt="" width="500" height="264" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image15-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another server I enjoy is “Freelance Nirvana”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nirvana means an ideal or idyllic state or place. This server wants to be a nice place for freelancers to help each other and promote their gigs on Discord. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a big server with over a thousand members with many threads for gig promotion. What I like about this server is that it is not platform specific, but allows for freelancers to find clients independently. It can still be useful for your Fiverr gig promotion.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image11.webp" alt="" width="283" height="208" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image11-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figcaption>Discord channels for Fiverr Promotion and job requests</figcaption></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can join this Discord community through this invite link:</span></p><p><a href="https://disboard.org/de/server/join/736086523421786162"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://disboard.org/de/server/join/736086523421786162</span></a></p><h3><strong>Fiverr Community</strong></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image14.webp" alt="" width="500" height="305" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image14-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I want to recommend you the (unofficial) Fiverr Community.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's an unofficial Fiverr server and the biggest discord community for Fiverr sellers and buyers alike. It's moderated through volunteers and rules are enforced strictly, so make sure to read the rules before posting in the gig promotion channels. Since this is a Fiverr promotion server, it's not allowed to post anything unrelated to Fiverr.

Don't write too much about you, interested clients can read about you and your gig on the actual Fiverr page. No need to clutter your profile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are new to Discord, then you might not know what a Discord profile looks like. It's a bit different or more minimalist than on other social media platforms. It's only shown when clicking on your profile image or name or when hovering over it. It will display a small card that is basically all your profile is. When clicked again, the Discord profile will show mutual servers and the profile description. That's it. No feed. Only a description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So remember this when creating your discord profile, only u</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">se as much text as neccessary. Use the limited text space wisely to promote your Fiverr gig effectively.</span></p><h3><strong>Discord profile example for Fiverr gig promotion</strong></h3><p>This is a simple example of the Discord profile text that you could use to get clicks on your Fiverr gig. Dont put too much, don't put anything weird.

It has a great effect on your reputation, when you help others and share your experiences. On the other hand, asking questions and actively seeking feedback on your work or your gig can be extremely valuable to you and others.</span></p><p><strong>Being active and helpful includes:</strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for feedback on your work or your gig</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask detailed questions about how Fiverr works</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help others by answering their questions</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write detailed answers or  feedback with tips for improvement</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help out the moderators by reporting spam</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, this behavior will have a strong impact on your career as a freelancer.

People are willing to share their experiences, tips and tricks for your success on Fiverr with you. But not when the questionnaire is not showing any effort. </span></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Discord Promotion: Do’s and Don’ts</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Discord  servers have some kind of promotion or advertisement channels where you can promote your Fiverr gigs and services for free. These channels are dedicated for promotion and can be very active. Some channels also have the Slow Mode activated, which prevents users from posting too often. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some tips to follow when promoting your Fiverr gigs in these Discord promotion channels:</span></p><h3><strong>Do’s when promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord</strong></h3><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a small and clean advertisement text</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call to action in your promotion text (see the template for discord promotion)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a link embed, or attach a small sample of work if the channel allows it.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post a few times a day, but don't spam the channel. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a friendly but professional attitude in your gig promotion. Even though Discord is a casual place, it is always good to have a professional and friendly attitude. Clients appreciate it alot and it will help potential clients to build trust. This already starts with your attitude in your promotion on Discord.</span></li></ul><h3><strong>Don’ts when promoting your Fiverr gigs on Discord</strong></h3><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not spam your promotion in other channels</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t use huge promotion texts that fill the whole page, this is considered being a bad sport and puts you in a bad light. Use a reasonable amount of space for your Fiverr promotion.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spelling mistakes. Even the smallest spelling mistake can scare off potential clients. Nobody will ever hire a writer or translator on Fiverr who has spelling mistakes in their description or their gig promotion on Discord.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not overuse smileys/emoticons. It is okay to use a few ones to emphasize certain parts of your promotion (for example the call of action) but do not put checkmarks on all of your Fiverr gig services.</span></li></ul><h3><strong>Follow the Discord Server rules: don’t spam &amp; direct messages</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tip seems to be obvious, but it happens daily that people do not read the rules and get kicked or banned from Discord servers. This will put you and your promotion in a very bad light or it will completely prevent you from using Discord as a promotion channel for your Fiverr gigs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's why you should always read the rules and have good manners when you are actively promoting your Fiverr gigs  on Discord servers. </span></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Fiverr gig promotion through direct messages on Discord</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One rule that applies to probably most servers where you would want to promote your Fiverr gigs on is restricted dms for server members. That means that you may not be able to directly message other members of the server). If it is allowed, then you might not be allowed to promote your Fiverr gig or other Discord servers in the dms. This is to prevent spam and scammers from using Discord to their advantage. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to use direct messages for promotion on Discord, make sure you follow the rules of the server to avoid bans or warnings. </span></p><h2><strong>Fiverr only promotion or any kind of promotion</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some servers allow only Fiverr gig promotion, others allow all kinds of promotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules vary from server to server, so you have to make sure to be aware of the specific set of rules that each server has. For example, the Fiverr Community server <strong>ONLY </strong>allows promotion of Fiverr gigs. The promotion needs to include a Fiverr link, otherwise the promoter will be warned and eventually banned from the server. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other servers are less strict. For example the Brackeys Game development community server has dedicated channels where members can promote their freelancing services and show off their gigs. It would be okay to post your Fiverr gig there, but you can also promote your services outside of Fiverr in these channels. </span></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Template for discord promotion Text</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many variations of promotions on Discord, but in my opinion short and concise promotion texts with a call to action are the most effective ones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One possible template for your discord promotion follows this simple principle:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotion Title</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1-2 Sentences about your gig</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 sentence about your experience</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 Call To Action</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Link to your Fiverr gig that you want to promote</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used this promotion text to for my tool the Fiverr Calculator </span><a href="https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with this Discord Promotion Template:</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image6.webp" alt="" width="500" height="368" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image6-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><h3><strong>Examples for a good Discord promotion text for your Fiverr gig</strong></h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image8-2.webp" alt="" width="450" height="244" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image8-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's a clean and structured promotion text with bullet points, a few visual elements for visual appeal and most importantly: A Call to Action to click on the Fiverr gig.

Again, bullet points with the most important features of the Fiverr gig and two visual elements for clarity. It's a compact and short promotion text, but it works. It doesn't take up too much space in the chat and won't seem like spam. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, this example is </span><strong>NOT</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perfect and can be improved further.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spelling mistakes in the promotion look unprofessional (“design”, “desing”)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No headline that directly states what this gig is about. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of “here is my Fiverr page”, a call to action would have been better and would turn more impressions into clicks to your Fiverr gig</span></li></ul><p><strong>Example for a bad Discord promotion text</strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/image7.webp" alt="" width="400" height="221" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-md.webp 768w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-lg.webp 1024w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-xl.webp 1360w, https://blog.fee-calculator.com/media/posts/7/responsive/image7-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This example shows how bad a promotion can be. These types of promotions are everywhere on Discord and it's a shame, because these types of promotions will only do you harm instead of boosting your gigs performance. It will make you look unprofessional and have a negative effect on your reputation. </span></p><p><strong><em>Why this promotion text sucks:</em></strong></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long list of features in one sentence. Use bullet points to list your gig features!</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of white space, that is also irregular. It makes the promotion look visually unappealing, it also seems like spam because it uses so much space in the chat. Some servers, for example Fiverr Insiders (<a href="Fiverr Insiders Discord Invite">https://discord.gg/Cjk97b5cEn</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) , even automute and warn users for using too much white space in their Discord promotions.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All CAPS “THANK YOU” is a very bad practice and will make you look unprofessional. Why are you screaming ?!</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please dm” is a very needy looking and ineffective call to action. Refer to our “Call to Action Examples for Discord promotions and Fiverr gig Descriptions” (ADD LINK)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why put a TikTok link, when this is supposed to be a Fiverr promotion? </span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, there are many things wrong with this promotion text and on some Discord servers, these kinds of spammy and unprofessional promotion texts might even get you banned or atleast muted from posting more in the gig promotion channels.</span></p><p> </p><h2><strong>How to get the most out of gig promotion and self promotion channels on Discord</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know how to write great promotion texts and which mistakes to avoid, we can discuss how you can get the most out of these promotion channels. </span></p><h3 style="margin-top: 2.28571rem; font-family: var(--font-base); font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); letter-spacing: var(--letter-spacing); font-size: 1.42383em;"><span style="color: var(--headings-color); font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);">Be consistent in promoting your Fiverr gigs</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simply posting your Fiverr promotion every now and then won't cut it. You need to post it in intervals and make sure you do it at least daily. But, do not spam those promotion channels! Consistency is key, turn promoting your Fiverr gigs into a daily routine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, posting your Fiverr gigs or promotions texts in regular intervals  is </span><strong>not enough</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an effective Discord promotion strategy. </span></p><h3><strong>Be active and helpful and a build a reputation on the Discord server</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may repeat myself, but this point is important for the effectiveness of your Fiverr promotion on Discord.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you simply post your Fiverr promotion and are not active on the server in any other way, it will look bad and will not help you as much. If you are helping people, share your knowledge (for free) . On the other hand, people will notice you and your promotions will be much more effective.</span></p><h3><strong>Posting custom promotions depending on the Discord server</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have found niché servers with potential clients and have established yourself as an active member of the community, you might be able to better understand how these potential clients could be converted into orders on Fiverr. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This step is not easy to do, it requires time and research of your clients. You need to understand their needs. If you do, you can tailor your Discord promotion for these niché Discord channels specifically to them. Your Fiverr promotion will be a lot more effective this way, because people already trust you and know you are knowledgeable and might be a good candidate for their project. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will help your Fiverr gig in the long run to get clicks and orders, since people that click on your custom tailored promotions are way more likely to become actual customers and put an order on your Fiverr gig.</span></p><h3><strong>Markdown-Example for Fiverr Discord promotion text</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use markdown syntax to have a more sophisticated and professional looking promotion text for your Fiverr gig. It is possible to fatten parts of the text. Do not over do this but use it only for the most important parts of your promotion and only for single words.</span></p><h4><strong>Markdown Example</strong></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made this tool for freelancers: Fiverr Calculator</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will help you save money and find the right price for your gigs! :money_with_wings: </span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> **--- Current Features ---** </span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">+** Fiverr, PayPal &amp; Payoneer Fees**</span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">+ **Hourly Rate**</span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">+ **Conversion Fees** </span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">See **exactly** what will be left from your gig price after all fees are applied. :white_check_mark: </span></em></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please bookmark my site if you find it useful! :star:</span></em></p><p><em><a href="https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://fee-calculator.com/fiverr-calculator</span></a></em></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Examples for Call To Actions specifically for Fiverr promotions on Discord</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call to actions have proven very effective in motivating the viewer of your Fiverr promotion to click on your gig or order from your services.

You are probably looking for ways to promote your Fiverr gig in general, so I wanted to give you a few tips to promote your Fiverr gigs in other ways. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, there's always room for improvement when it comes to marketing your services. But as you put up your Fiverr gig, you hope to get some attention for it. But how do you go about promoting your gig  and get it in front of potential buyers? By following the tips in this section, you can increase your chances of getting noticed and making a sale through other ways of promotion as well. </span></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Use social media to establish your brand</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platforms like Twitter and Facebook are great for getting the word out about your Fiverr gig. Just be sure to use relevant hashtags so that people can easily find your gig. </span></p><h3><strong>Place Instagram, Facebook and Google Ads</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not a free way of promoting your Fiverr gigs, but it can be very effective. These ad services are mostly paid only for clicks on your ads and conversion, so the ads are worth it if you set them up right.</span></p><h3><strong>Tell your friends and family about it</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may not all be potential customers, but they can help spread the word to people who are. It is also valuable to get feedback from your friends and family or even better, industry experts or other freelancers. Don’t be afraid to share your Fiverr gigs with people you know.</span></p><h3><strong>Use other online platforms and forums</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of online communities and forums where you can promote your Fiverr gig. Do a little research to find the ones that are most relevant to your gig, and then start sharing! You will be surprised how many forums in your industry are out there. The same rules that I described in this guide for Fiverr Discord promotion apply to promoting your gigs in forums. You need to be an active and helpful part of the community to get the most out of this way of marketing.</span></p><h3><strong>Get creative with your marketing</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are endless possibilities when it comes to promoting your Fiverr gig. Get creative and think outside the box – the more unique and original your approach, the more likely you are to stand out from the crowd. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep at it! Promoting your Fiverr gig takes time and effort, but it will all be worth it when you start seeing results. </span></p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply the tips and tricks from this ultimate guide to discord promotion for your Fiverr gigs, you might see the results quickly! But remember, you need to be patient, active and consistent. Establish yourself in a world full of other freelancers, who also promote their gigs.
